- 👋 Hi, iamneo.ai, formerly Examly, founded in 2016, is an AI-powered EdTech Startup from Coimbatore (நம்ம கோவை-ங்க),  Tamil Nadu.  We are as passionate about education as we are about technology. We firmly believe that AI is not here to replace or outperform human tasks but to co-exist and work together to offer solutions to various problems across the globe. 

Our AI-driven Adaptive Learning Platform caters to students, universities, and corporates in all their needs of learning, upskilling, assessment, recruiting and whatnot. Our platforms are capable of recognizing individual learning patterns of students and curating content for an immersive learning experience.
